# Phrase Hunter
**The rules of the game**

This game will be entirely console/terminal based.

The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning of the game, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by an underscore character _ as a placeholder on the screen for a given letter for that phrase.

The player inputs a guess for a letter in the phrase.

Once a correct letter is guessed, a player cannot guess that letter again.

If the guessed letter is in the phrase at least once, the phrase will replace all positions showing the underscore _ with the appropriate letter. All occurrences of that letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).

If the selected letter is not in the phrase, the player loses a "life" (the player only has a limited number of "lives").

The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or until they make five incorrect guesses.
